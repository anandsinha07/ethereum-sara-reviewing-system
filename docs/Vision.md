In recent years, many organizations have sprung up which publish journals submitted to the conferences organized by them. However such organizations do not check the quality of the papers/journals submitted to them and publish them by taking money from the authors. Even the authors donâ€™t object since they can mention their publications in the resume. Due to such malpractices the quality of papers available for the scientific community degrades. Hence there is a need of a system which can assure the credibility of the papers published and gain the trust of the people who will be referring such papers for their research. This paper proposes a new quality assessment system of papers using ethereum blockchain. The system aims at using the distributed nature of blockchain for reviewing of papers and also rewarding those who provide value to the system by their contributions.
